For those who are studying the data-centric-dev module and using GitPod :slightly_smiling_face: After having those questions myself and seeing so many posts lately about it;
Also to have only one thread where useful information is available;
Here are my tips to run Flask or MySQL or to link up Heroku:
First, make sure to use Code Institute Full template prepared for us:
https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template
Use this template
Create your own repo
Open GitPod from GitHub to open workspace for the first time and then only open GitPod directly and workspace
For Flask:
To install via CLI: pip3 install Flask
To import inside the app.py: from flask import Flask
To view app.py in the browser: python3 app.py (even if your workspace has already python3)
You also might need to set your environment variables inside the file to run it to browser:
os.getenv(“IP”, “0.0.0.0”) or os.environ.get(“IP”, “0.0.0.0”)
os.getenv(“PORT”, “5000”) or os.environ.get(“PORT”, “5000”)
For Heroku:
To show all heroku commands in CLI: heroku
To login: 1-Type heroku login, 2-Press any key to open up the browser to login, 3-Click on link provided in CLI, 4-Click login on new page opened, 5-Go back to IDE and heroku is logged in
For MySQL:
To use mySQL from CLI: mysql
At mysql prompt: start using other commands like “show databases;”
To import external database in MySQL via CLI: mysql < Chinook_MySql_AutoIncrementPKs.sql
This is it for now but I will update it whenever I find a process different than in the course videos, until they update them of course :wave::skin-tone-3: :wave::skin-tone-3:

-******************************-

dont forget to remove any downloaded db files, due to size and add to .gitignore

when using libraries its a good idea to keep a record of which ones youve used
and which versions   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
